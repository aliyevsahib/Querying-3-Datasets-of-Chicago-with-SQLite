# Querying Public Schools, Crime, and Socioeconomic Datasets of Chicago with SQLite
Notebook-driven analysis across three Chicago datasets—Public Schools, Crime, and Socioeconomic—using Python (pandas), SQLite, and ipython-sql. Load CSVs → create tables, inspect with PRAGMA, clean types (percentages/dates), join on community-area keys, and answer queries on safety, attendance, crime patterns, and income disparities—reproducibly.
